// THE PAGE SHELL OWNS ITS OWN HEIGHT.
//
// It used to inherit one, through `html, body { height: 100% }` in
// global.css and a chain of `flex-grow: 1` down to here. That chain resolves
// against the initial containing block, and a horizontal scrollbar takes 15px
// out of it -- so a single element wide enough to cause one made the whole
// shell shorter than the window, and the footer stopped short of the bottom
// with the body's background showing underneath.
//
// A viewport-relative minimum cannot be shortened that way. `dvh` is the
// dynamic viewport, which is what a phone's collapsing address bar leaves;
// `vh` is the fallback for anything that does not know the unit yet.
//
// `minHeight`, not `height`: a long page still grows past it.
const shell = {
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  // `#__next` is a flex row, so this keeps the shell full width.

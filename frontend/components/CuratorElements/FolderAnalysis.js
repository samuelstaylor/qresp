              The scope this dialog describes is enforced by the server, not by

              and raw dataset values, image bytes, notebook code cells and

              a paragraph nobody finishes. Nine lines of bullets restating it
              mostly taught curators to click past the consent step -- which
              is the one thing a consent step must not teach.

              What stays is what the reader cannot get anywhere else: what is

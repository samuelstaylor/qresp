// It replaces four separate top-level sections -- Add Charts, Add Tools, Add
// Datasets, Add Scripts -- that asked a curator to think in Qresp's storage
// categories and then, separately, to connect them. Nobody curating a paper
// thinks that way. They think: here is a figure; this script made it; it used
// this data and these tools.
//
// So the figure is the root, and everything else hangs off the question it
// answers. The four artifact MODELS are untouched -- a Figure is the existing
// Chart, and every form opened here is the existing form with its existing
// validation. Only the way in is different.
//
// WHAT A CONTEXTUAL BUTTON DOES. It remembers what the new artifact should be
// attached to, then opens the real form. When the form saves and the artifact
// appears, the edge is created from what the two things ARE -- see
// `inferEdgeType`. Cancel saves nothing, so nothing is attached to nothing.

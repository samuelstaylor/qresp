// Contact, as a page rather than a `mailto:` in the navigation bar.
//
// The header's Contact entry used to be
// `mailto:datadev@lists.uchicago.edu?subject=Qresp`. Clicking a navigation
// link and having the browser hand the page to a mail client is a jarring
// thing to do to somebody who only wanted to know how to get in touch — and
// on a machine with no mail client configured it does nothing at all, so the
// link looked broken. It also offered exactly one way to reach the project,
// when most of what people want to say ("this is broken", "here is a fix")
// belongs in the issue tracker.
//
// So: a page that shows the address as TEXT (copyable, and visible before you
// commit to anything), keeps the mail client one click away for those who
// want it, and names the two GitHub routes that are usually the right ones.

const EMAIL = "datadev@lists.uchicago.edu";
// The list is a shared inbox that receives more than Qresp. A pre-filled
// subject is what lets whoever reads it sort this mail without opening it,
// and costs the sender nothing -- it is still editable in their mail client.

          Questions about Qresp, a record you are curating, or a Qresp server?
          Write to the DataDev list. For anything about the software itself —
          a bug report or a feature request — GitHub is faster, and the issue
          stays where the people who can act on it will see it.

              `mailto:` navigation entry never allowed -- while the link keeps
              a mail client one click away for those who want it.

              Deliberately NOT a button. A contact address is a fact to read,

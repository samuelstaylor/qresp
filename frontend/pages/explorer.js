// answer a question before seeing anything -- and answering it wrong (Duke,
// currently unreachable) produced a blocking "Search Error!" modal over a page
// reading "0 Records Available", which is indistinguishable from a node that
// genuinely has no records. The overwhelmingly common intent is "show me the
// records", so that is what the URL now does.
//
// Which server is NOT decided here. `/api/federation/servers` is the
// authoritative list -- it is the same set the backend enforces `?server=`
// against -- and it now publishes `default_server` alongside it. Nothing in
// this file names a host: a hardcoded default would be a second copy of the
// federation config, and the first copy already drifted once.
//

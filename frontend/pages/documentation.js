// Qresp documentation, in the app.
//
// The reference documentation lives at qresp.org and still does — it is linked
// below. What belongs HERE is the part a curator needs while they are
// curating: how to lay a project out before pointing Qresp at it.
//
// There is exactly ONE folder layout on this site, and it is the Qresp Folder
// Standard v1 at /documentation/folder-standard. This page used to carry a
// second, general research-package template as well (project/, data/raw/,
// data/processed/, figures/) with its own copy button. Two copyable structures
// side by side asked a reader to pick, and the one they were most likely to
// pick was the one on this page — which the RCC analyzer does not read. It is
// gone rather than relabelled: a caveat under a copy button is not a match for
// the button.
//
// Legacy folder names (data, Figures_Tables, Plot_Scripts, doc) are still
// recognized by the analyzer exactly as before. Removing a suggestion from the
// documentation changes nothing about what Qresp can READ — that is the whole
// reason it was safe to remove.

          Qresp curates whatever structure you already have, and never renames

// from one node beside a record from another — and the same paper can be
// published on both. The job here is to show that paper ONCE, and to keep
// track of which node each copy came from so its detail link resolves.
//
// The node is NOT shown to a reader. A Qresp node is shared federation and
// search infrastructure; which one served a copy says nothing about who wrote
// the paper or where the work was done, and a badge naming the operating
// institution invited exactly that misreading. `sourceLabel` survives for
// internal use and for operator-facing diagnostics.
//
// What is derived here is never guessed. A label comes from
// `qresp_server_name` in the federation list (`/api/federation/servers`,
// which the backend builds from the same entries it enforces `?server=`
// against); deriving a name from a hostname would be a regex that breaks the
// moment a node is renamed or two nodes share a domain. A node with no name
// published falls back to its HOST, which is still true.

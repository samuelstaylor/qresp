// THE artifact field contract. One definition, used by every surface that

//
// Folder Analysis used to hardcode its own labels, its own required set and
// its own draft shape, alongside whatever the Add/Edit forms happened to say.
// They drifted, and the drift was visible to curators: the same field was
// "Keywords" in one place and "Properties (comma separated)" in the other,
// an input labelled "Keywords" wrote to `URLs`, and optional fields were
// flagged "Needs input". Anything that renders, marks, validates or converts
// an artifact field reads this file instead.
//
// `key` is the STORAGE key and never changes for compatibility: a chart's
// keywords live in `properties` because every published record already
// stores them there.

// A Chart is a FIGURE: one image, its number in the paper, the paper's own
// caption for it, and the files it was made from. The labels say so. The
// storage keys deliberately do not move -- every published record already
// uses them -- and `caption` is never softened into a generic "Description",
// because a figure caption is a specific thing a paper already has.

// input" chip under a caption the AI had just filled -- the analyser marked
// the field `needs_input` because it was EMPTY THEN, and nothing re-read it --
// while the card header, which counts (2), correctly said the field was no
// longer missing. The same staleness would have let a "High" chip, earned by
// a file path the analyser detected, vouch for a path a curator typed over it.
//
// These three helpers are the only place the facts are combined.

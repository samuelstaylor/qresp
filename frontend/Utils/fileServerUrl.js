// in three ways:
//   * the file server path is EMPTY until "Save File Server" is pressed, so
//     a chart applied from folder analysis produced "/figures/x.png" — a
//     path on the Qresp origin, which silently 404s as a blank image;
//   * manually picked paths arrive with a leading slash (Scraper.node strips
//     the server prefix and leaves one) while analyzed paths do not, so the
//     result was inconsistent — ".../DOI//figures/x.png";
//   * spaces and other URL-significant characters in real folder names were
//     never encoded.
//
// Returns "" when it cannot build a real absolute URL, so callers can render
// an explicit fallback instead of a broken <img>.

/**
 * Would this URL be blocked by the browser before the network is touched?
 *
 * An `https://` Qresp page may not load an `http://` sub-resource: the browser
 * refuses it as mixed content, the `<img>` fires `onerror`, and the failure is
 * indistinguishable from a 404 or an untrusted certificate from inside the
 * page. It is NOT indistinguishable to a reader, though, because the fix is a
 * different one: the file server's saved URL needs `https`, and no amount of
 * trusting a certificate or checking the file exists will help.
 *
 * Returns false when it cannot tell (no `window`, an unparseable URL), so a
 * caller falls back to the general message rather than asserting a cause it
 * has not established.
 *
 * `pageUrl` defaults to the current page and exists so this can be reasoned
 * about — and tested — without reaching for a global that jsdom will not let
 * anyone redefine.

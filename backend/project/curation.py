"""Deterministic RCC folder analysis for assisted curation.

One endpoint (wired through swagger.yml):
- POST /api/curation/analyze-folder   inventory + classify a file-server folder

The response is an ANALYSIS ONLY: nothing is written to MongoDB, drafts, disk
or published metadata, and no candidate becomes a record until the curator
reviews it in the browser and explicitly applies it.

Safety model:
- The browser never supplies a fetchable URL. It supplies a path that must sit
  under one of the server's OWN allowed file-server roots (scheme + host +
  base path pinned by QRESP_FILESERVER_ROOTS, defaulting to the RCC root the
  curator picker already offers). Anything else — another host, a scheme
  change, credentials in the URL, a query/fragment, `..` or percent-encoded
  traversal — is refused before a single request is made.
- Discovery is bounded: depth, directory requests, file count, per-file bytes
  and a request timeout, with an explicit `truncated` flag when a cap is hit.
- TLS verification is ON by default. The legacy Dtree scraper passes
  verify=False unconditionally; that is deliberately NOT inherited here. A
  narrow, environment-only, default-off, per-host opt-in exists for the one
  known RCC host whose certificate has expired
  (QRESP_FILESERVER_INSECURE_TLS_HOSTS) — never settable from the browser.
- Directory contents and source text are never logged.

    "docstring, comment_header and notebook_markdown: text a human wrote "

# A deploy breaks when a declared dependency is not actually installed by the
# image that runs. The unit tests cannot catch that on their own, because they
# pass whenever the package happens to be present in the developer's
# environment. What they CAN pin is that the Docker build path installs from
# the declared files at all.

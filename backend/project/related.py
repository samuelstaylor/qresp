"""Related Research: what else in the literature bears on this record.

One read-only endpoint (wired through swagger.yml):
- GET /api/paper/{id}/related

It answers with two independent lists:

* **Related Qresp Records** -- computed here, from the published scientific
  metadata of the active records this server holds. No external service is
  involved and no configuration is required.
* **Related External Papers** -- candidates proposed by the free Semantic
  Scholar Recommendations API, RE-RANKED by Qresp's deterministic relevance
  score. Being returned by the provider IS enough to be shown; Qresp's own
  evidence gate (the one Related Qresp Records is filtered by) is computed
  for every candidate and carried as a diagnostic, but it never removes one.
  The provider's own ranking survives too, as the tie-break when two
  candidates score identically -- it is discarded only as the PRIMARY order,
  never dropped outright.

The two lists have SEPARATE caps and SEPARATE policies, and deliberately so.

Related Qresp Records shows at most `MAX_RESULTS` (3) records from this
server's own corpus, and only the ones that PASS Qresp's evidence gate
(`relatedness.rank`).

Related External Papers asks the provider for `EXTERNAL_CANDIDATE_LIMIT`
(150) candidates, deduplicates them, scores every one that survives, and
shows the best `EXTERNAL_MAX_RESULTS` (25) by that score
(`relatedness.rerank_external`) -- laid out five to a page over at most five
pages. NOTHING is removed here for failing the evidence gate: a candidate
with weak or zero Qresp signal can still appear, typically near the tail of
the 25, because Semantic Scholar proposed it. All 0-25 come back in one
response and are cached as one entry, so turning a page in the UI is a slice
of data the browser already holds and costs no provider request.

No language model is involved anywhere in this feature. Every ordering,
threshold and "Why related" sentence comes from `project/relatedness.py`,
which is pure and unit-tested.

Nothing here writes to a Paper. Recommendations are a derived view, so they
are never pinned into the canonical record: they are recomputed (internal) or
cached separately with an expiry (external, `RelatedResearchCache`), which is
what lets a new follow-up study show up on a record published years ago. The
external cache is additionally keyed by a fingerprint of the record's public
scientific metadata, so an edit to the title or the abstract refreshes the
answer at once instead of waiting out the TTL.

Configuration is ENVIRONMENT ONLY (QRESP_RELATED_RESEARCH_*,
QRESP_RELATED_EXTERNAL_ENABLED, QRESP_SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_*), deliberately not
`Config.get_setting`: that helper falls back to config.ini, and neither the
credential nor the switch for an external call should be configurable (or
accidentally committed) there. Both switches are OFF by default, and the
external one is subordinate to the master one -- see `config()`.

Federated records
-----------------
The Explorer can open a record that lives on ANOTHER Qresp server
(`/paperdetails/{id}?server=https://peer.example.org`). Such a record is not in
this server's database, so `?server=` is passed through to this endpoint too:
the record and the corpus it is scored against are then read from that peer via
`project/federation.py`, which is also what refuses every server that is not in
the federated registry. The peer must be an allowlisted HTTPS origin; only
allowlisted published metadata is copied out of its answer; nothing is written
to this server's database. Scoring, the evidence gate, the re-ranking, the
result caps and the external provider are the same code in both modes -- the
only difference is where the two record sets came from. That includes WHICH
list is gated: Related Qresp Records is filtered by the gate on a federated
record exactly as it is locally, and Recommended External Papers is re-ranked
without one, exactly as it is locally.

What leaves this server
-----------------------
To a federated peer: two plain GETs, `/api/paper/{id}` and `/api/search`, both
public reads carrying no credential and no user data.

To the recommendation provider, only what is needed to identify THIS paper: its
DOI, or --
when it has none -- its published title. Nothing else: no abstract, no
authors, no keywords, no RCC URL, no file path, no file content, no owner,
editor, curator or session data, and no other record. The provider host is a
fixed HTTPS constant in this file; no environment variable or request
parameter can redirect it. The API key, when configured, travels only in the
`x-api-key` header and is never logged, cached, or returned.

# answers empty and that the external half was therefore useless for Qresp.
# That was too pessimistic, and instrumenting the pipeline is what showed it:
#
#   from=recent (the default)  ->  the provider RESOLVES the paper every time
#                                  (`resolved: true`), and then returns either
#                                  0 candidates or a full 20. Of three real
#                                  PaperStack records checked, one came back
#                                  with 20 candidates, of which 3 cleared

#                                  0.16) and no candidate shared even three
#                                  specific terms. All 38 would score at the
#                                  very bottom of a re-ranked list today, and

#      new behaviour would show a reader a one-page list and call it the
#      whole answer.
#   5  external results are RE-RANKED, not gated: Qresp's evidence gate no
#      longer removes a Semantic Scholar candidate from Recommended External
#      Papers, only orders it (relatedness.rerank_external). An entry written
#      under 4 holds only the candidates that happened to pass the OLD gate,
#      which is a materially different -- and narrower -- list than this
#      policy produces; serving it would show a reader a stale, gate-filtered
#      answer under the new contract. Related Qresp Records is UNCHANGED by
#      this bump: it is still gated and still capped at three, and its
#      in-process federated cache entries are invalidated only because the

#      the citations endpoint -- later work citing it -- re-ranked by the same
#      score and labelled as a different source. An entry written under 5
#      recorded that emptiness as final, with `provider_returned_no_candidates`
#      and no results; serving it would keep showing an empty list for a paper
#      this policy can now answer. The bump is also what keeps the two sources
#      out of each other's cache: an entry carries the `source_kind` it was
#      built from, and one written before that field existed cannot be
#      mistaken for either.
#   7  the citations fallback now records what it did even when it found
#      nothing or failed (`pipeline.fallback`). An entry written under 6 for
#      a paper with no recommendations carries no trace of whether the

    attempt, not about the response: a background refresh that fails while a
    good stale answer survives returns that good answer and still reports a
    failure, which is what starts the cooldown.

    What is cached, and for how long, depends on what came back:

    * a real answer keeps RESULT_TTL_SECONDS fresh plus
      RESULT_STALE_TTL_SECONDS servable-while-refreshing;
    * a peer failure keeps NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS only -- long enough to stop a
      hot page turning one outage into a request storm, short enough that a
      reader who retries gets a real attempt;
    * a 404 is not cached here at all: it is cheap, and the peer's own
      negative cache already covers the repeated lookup.

    `preserve_stale` is what a BACKGROUND refresh passes. A refresh that fails
    must not replace a real answer with an empty one: the reader was already
    being served something true, and a peer being briefly unreachable is not a
    reason to take it away. The failure is still recorded -- by the guard's
    cooldown -- so it is not retried on every view either.

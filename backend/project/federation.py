"""Reading a published record from ANOTHER Qresp server.

Qresp has always been federated, but only in the browser: the Explorer lets a
reader pick servers, `pages/search.js` fetches `/api/search` from each one, and
`pages/paperdetails/[id].js` fetches `/api/paper/{id}` from whichever server the
`?server=` query names. The backend was never part of that -- every handler it
has answers from its own MongoDB and nothing else.

That is fine while a page only needs to DISPLAY a remote record. It stops being
fine the moment a backend feature has to REASON about one: Related Research
scores a record against a corpus, so asking this server about a record it does
not hold can only ever be a 404.

This module is the missing half. It answers two questions, and nothing else:

  1. May this server be contacted at all?  (`resolve_server`)
  2. What does it say about a record, and about its corpus?
     (`fetch_record`, `fetch_corpus`)

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
* It never writes. A federated record is read, scored and discarded; it is
  never saved to this server's MongoDB, so a Qresp node can never accumulate
  shadow copies of another node's records.
* It never copies a whole payload. `/api/paper/{id}` carries the curator's
  name, e-mail and affiliation, the RCC server path, the file-server path and
  the download/notebook paths. Only the published SCIENTIFIC metadata listed
  in the allowlists below is copied out; everything else is dropped at the
  boundary and cannot reach a profile, a cache entry or a response.
* It never takes a URL from the caller on trust. The only servers reachable
  through here are the ones the federated registry already names -- the same
  list the Explorer and the publish flow use.

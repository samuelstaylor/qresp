"""Shared Gemini transport, and one of Qresp's two AI features.

This module owns `POST /api/assist/keywords` (`suggest_keywords` below), and
it provides the provider call, the configuration, the per-user daily quota
and the keyword normalizer that `project/curation.py` uses for RCC
folder-candidate descriptions.

Those are the two -- and the only two -- places a language model is involved
in Qresp:

* keyword suggestions for the record being curated (here), and
* descriptions/keywords for RCC folder candidates (`project/curation.py`).

Both are opt-in, suggestion-only, and never auto-applied or stored.

Bibliography is NOT one of those places: publication metadata comes from the
DOI registry and from what the curator types, never from a model.

Disabled by default; configured EXCLUSIVELY via environment variables
(QRESP_GEMINI_*) -- never config.ini. Google Gemini is the single selected
provider: this is deliberately NOT a multi-provider framework, and the API
host below is fixed in code so no configuration can redirect text somewhere
else.

The credential is a dedicated Google AI Studio / Gemini API key sent in the
x-goog-api-key header. It is completely separate from the Google OAuth
sign-in client (QRESP_GOOGLE_*), which this module never reads: no OAuth
token, user credential, Drive/Gmail scope, grounding, search, URL context,
code execution, or file upload is involved.

Privacy/safety model:
- Callers send bounded, allowlisted payloads only.
- Content stays in memory: never persisted, logged, echoed back, or recorded
  in the usage counter.
- The payload is DATA, not instructions: a fixed prompt asks for a JSON
  answer only; no tools, no web access, no instruction-following.
- Provider errors, keys, and prompts are never exposed to the client.
- A persistent per-user daily request limit protects the shared quota.

# actually uses. `readme` (dataset/script description) and `facilityName`
# (tool facility) therefore matched nothing and were silently dropped, so the
# artifacts the curator attached contributed far less than the UI promised.
#
# Canonical names come first and win. The trailing entries are confirmed
# legacy spellings -- `description` for a dataset, `facilityname` as declared
# in models.py -- accepted so an older client or an older record still works.
# The server resolves these itself and never trusts the client to have picked
# the right one.

# imageFile, notebookFile, ids, versions, and everything about the curator or

"""What may be shown to a model about a script, and nothing else.

`project/codelinks.py` reads what a script SAYS outright: a literal path in a
known I/O call. Plenty of real work is not written that way --

    python preprocess.py "$INPUT" > data/clean.csv
    python plot.py data/clean.csv figures/result.png

-- and a shell script or a wrapper leaves the static reader with nothing. A
curator can ask a model to look at those lines. This module decides WHAT IT
MAY SEE, which is a much smaller question than what it might be useful for.

THE RULE IS AN ALLOWLIST, not a blocklist. Only these leave the server:

  * the relative path and language of the script's own sources
  * short excerpts from those sources, around the lines that mention a file
  * the line -- or cell and line -- each excerpt came from
  * file-like tokens the static reader could not resolve
  * the id, type and relative path of candidates the folder scan already found

Never: the contents of a dataset, image bytes, notebook OUTPUT, `.env`, a key
of any kind, anything about the account, anything from another folder, or the
paper's text. A line that mentions a credential is dropped whole rather than
trimmed, because a redaction that is 95% right is a leak.

Nothing here calls a provider. It builds a bundle; `curation.py` decides
whether it is ever sent, and only after the curator says so.
